<strong><p>Note (July 31, 2019): I've decided to upgrade my website! The <a href="/blog">blog</a> and <a href="/lab">lab</a> are moving to the same page. I'm also going to add more content types, like songs, galleries, and videos. As I migrate things over, I'll be backfilling my blog with content to test with. This is an example of filler content.</p></strong>
