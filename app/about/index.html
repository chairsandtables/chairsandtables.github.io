      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I am an artist, engineer, and educator. My work has been featured on NPR, the CBC, HuffPost, Canadian Business, and elsewhere. I volunteer at <a href="http://repairmatters.ca/">Repair Matters</a> and <a href="https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/">Canada Learning Code</a>, and am slowly developing my thoughts on <a href="https://github.com/miseryco/curriculum">what digital literacy means on today's Internet</a>.</p>
      <p>Throughout my career, I have focused on accessibility, mentorship, and community. I am a proud graduate of the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> and the <a href="http://sfpc.io/">School for Poetic Computation</a>. I have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, with a focus on human-computer interaction.</p>
      <p>I have been recognized as one of Canada's 30 Under 30 developers, which is honestly quite silly.</p>
